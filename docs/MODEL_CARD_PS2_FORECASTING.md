## 2. Mathematical Formalization of Time-to-Compromise (TTC)

### Formal Formula Disclosure
$$\text{TTC}(s, \mathbf{x}) = \left(\sum_{k=s+1}^{6} T_k\right) \times \left(1.0 - 0.45 \cdot \text{clip}\left(\frac{\text{burst\_qps}}{25.0}, 0.0, 1.0\right)\right) \times \left(0.60 + 0.40 \cdot (1.0 - C)\right)$$

Where:
1. **$s \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$**: Current classified kill-chain stage index.
2. **$T_k$**: Canonical baseline stage duration constants (minutes):
   - $T_1$ (Reconnaissance): $10.0\text{ min}$
   - $T_2$ (Initial Access): $15.0\text{ min}$
   - $T_3$ (Discovery): $12.0\text{ min}$
   - $T_4$ (C2 Persistence): $18.0\text{ min}$
   - $T_5$ (Lateral Movement): $22.0\text{ min}$
   - $T_6$ (Exfiltration / Impact): $0.0\text{ min}$ (Terminal state)
3. **$\text{burst\_qps}$**: Measured query / flow burst rate over the 900-second session window. Automated APT scripting with high burst velocity compresses phase duration by up to $45\%$.
4. **$C \in [0.0, 1.0]$**: Current stage model confidence. High confidence projects streamlined attacker advancement ($0.60\times$), whereas low confidence models attacker hesitation and dwell time ($1.00\times$).
5. **Boundary Conditions**: For Benign ($s=0$) and Terminal Exfiltration ($s=6$), $\text{TTC} = 0.0\text{ min}$.

## 3. Scope & Operational Boundaries

### Supported Ingestion Modalities
- **Structured NetFlow / IPFIX JSON**: Ingestion via `POST /flow/batch` and `POST /flow/packet`.
- **PCAP / PCAP-NG File Parsing**: Struct-based raw Ethernet / IPv4 / TCP / UDP / DNS frame extractor via `POST /flow/pcap`.

### Explicit Scope Constraints & Limitations
- **No Raw UDP Socket Kernel Daemon**: In accordance with the modular microservice architecture, live packet ingestion operates over structured HTTP endpoints. A promiscuous kernel socket daemon (e.g. `AF_PACKET` / raw `pcap_loop`) is omitted in this demonstration build in favor of reproducible containerized JSON/PCAP flow telemetry.
- **PCAP Safety Boundary**: PCAP file uploads are capped at $20\text{ MB}$ (`MAX_PCAP_SIZE_BYTES`), execute with bounded memory allocation, and are designated as a **Lab & Evaluation Diagnostic Endpoint**.

## 4. Hardware Relay Preemptive Trigger Logic (Software Emulation)
- When the projected threat reaches $\text{STAGE\_5}$ (Lateral Movement) or $\text{STAGE\_4}$ with high velocity ($\text{TTC} < 15\text{m}$), the engine flags `hardware_relay_required = True`.
- **Software Emulation Disclosure**: In this reference implementation, the relay trip is an emulated software signal payload designed to interface with a Zephyr RTOS Microcontroller (ESP32-S3 / RP2040) over GPIO 18. **No physical microcontroller board is required or physically attached in this standard software evaluation build.**

## 5. Explainability Architecture & Taxonomy
- **ML Lexical Inference (`services/ml-inference`)**: Uses true TreeSHAP (`shap.TreeExplainer`) on Random Forest & LightGBM lexical models to generate exact mathematical Shapley attribution values ($\phi$) for character entropy, n-grams, and vowel ratios.
- **Temporal Attack Forecasting (`services/forecasting_engine`)**: Uses normalized additive heuristic indicator weights across session burst QPS, C2 heartbeat periodicity, SYN flood ratio, and DNS tunneling markers to explain kill-chain phase classification.
